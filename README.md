Just play with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Game of Life maybe be a goal, will see.

## Linking with Hello C

To be able to use raylib we first need to be able to link our rust code with

- [x] first step is to call a C function that is implemented in `clib/`.

## Linking with Raylib

You need to get `libraylib.a` and copy it into `clib/`

- [x] Start by implementing [Basic Window](https://www.raylib.com/examples/core/loader.html?name=core_basic_window)
- [ ] Draw a rectangle and move it...
